## Overview:

This game features the challenge of time in a clock tower that runs for 12 hours of the clock. One hour in game equals 30 seconds in real time. 

Player will control a hero with two abilities: melee attack (using the chain), and ranged attack (using the lantern). Each ability has different cooldown duration and damage. 

The boss in this tower is the ghost of the tower master. It will evolve as the game progresses. Its final form will appear at 12AM, while earlier forms will appear at 3PM, 6PM, and 9PM. Hero needs to defeat all the boss's forms before the end of 12 hours in order to win the game. 

The game also has a special item, Saving Grace item, which is dropped randomly by enemies. This item effect would be automatically activated to revive the player back to the previous clock hour if the player died.
